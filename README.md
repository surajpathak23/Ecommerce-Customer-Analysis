# Ecommerce Customer Analysis

This project was developed during my internship at **Xplore**. It focuses on analyzing an e-commerce customer dataset to uncover insights into user behavior and purchasing patterns. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making through preprocessing, outlier detection, and feature engineering.

## 📊 Key Highlights

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values (e.g., NaT in date columns) and standardized formats.
- 🚨 **Outlier Detection**: Identified and treated outliers using IQR and Z-score methods.
- 🧠 **Feature Engineering**:
  - Customer Tenure
  - Average Order Value
  - Days Since Last Order
  - Age Groups & Income Brackets
  - Spending Categories
- 🛠️ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Excel

## 📁 Files Included

- `E-commerce Project.ipynb` – Full Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis
- `ecommerce_customers_large.csv` – Raw dataset
- `final_ecommerce_data.xlsx` – Cleaned & transformed data

## 🚀 Objective

To demonstrate practical data analytics skills in cleaning, exploration, transformation, and reporting of a real-world dataset.
